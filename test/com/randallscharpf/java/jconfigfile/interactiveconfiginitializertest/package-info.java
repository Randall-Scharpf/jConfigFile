/**
 * Tests for com.randallscharpf.java.jconfigfile.InteractiveConfigInitializer and,
 * by thin proxy, com.randallscharpf.java.jconfigfile.ConfigInitializerDialog.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note that because these tests validate complex entry-point functions which handle
 * a variety of features, they are closer to end-to-end tests than unit tests; they
 * are included in the unit testing package primarily because they use assertions
 * and test fixtures from jUnit.
